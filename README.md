# Terraform module for Standalone FortiGate VM

## Introduction

This example Terraform code illustrates how to deploy Standalone FortiGate VM, using the module provided in the [modules directory](https://github.com/40net-cloud/terraform-azure-fortigate/tree/main/modules/single).

The goal is to streamline the deployment process for users and offer a more efficient method for managing the associated resources.

The outcome of this deployment is similar to the deployment [here](https://github.com/fortinet/azure-templates/tree/main/FortiGate/A-Single-VM).

## Deployment

### Overview

The Terraform code provisions a resource group that includes the following resources:

- FortiGate virtual machine configured with two network interfaces: external, internal. 
- A virtual network (VNet) with two subnets: external, internal.
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to FortiGate VM  interfaces.
- One public IP for management access to FGT-a (attached to external interface).

### Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy:

1. Navigate to the example directory (e.g., `examples/single`).
2. Review variables defined in  `examples/single/variables.tf` and ensure the all default values meet your requirements. Modify them as needed.
3. Rename the file `terraform.tfvars.txt` to `terraform.tfvars`.
4. Fill in the required variables in `terraform.tfvars` file.
5. Run the following commands:
<code><pre>
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
</code></pre>
